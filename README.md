# otempl

## Template development exercise

Still extremely simple.

The idea was first to have a template hard coded in python structures and
files with data, that would feed the template, in yaml format.

From this came de ridiculous idea of the name Yet Another Template Markup
Language. So original that I beg you not to tell anybody.

At the end, obviously, both, template as data values, can be in both formats.

There are two classes:
- OTempl, that receive template and values in structured data
- OYatml, that receive de name of two yaml files, that feed the two needed
  structured data, template and values

The "O" at the beginnig is from Oxigenai, my small programming company.


There is no error handling.
